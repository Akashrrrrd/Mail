# üõ°Ô∏è MailSense Trust Building Strategy

## üéØ **The Trust Challenge**

### **User Concerns About Email Access**
- üíº **Business Users**: "Will my company data be secure?"
- üë§ **Personal Users**: "Can they read my private emails?"
- üè¶ **Financial Info**: "What about banking and payment emails?"
- üîê **Login Credentials**: "Will they see my passwords and 2FA codes?"

### **Competitive Landscape**
- **Gmail**: Users already trust Google with their email
- **Outlook**: Microsoft has enterprise trust
- **Third-party apps**: Face same trust barriers (Boomerang, Mixmax, etc.)

## üõ°Ô∏è **MailSense Trust Advantages**

‚úÖ AUTO-CLEANUP: Cache cleared every 2 minutes
```

### **2. Google-Grade Security**
```
‚úÖ GOOGLE OAUTH: Uses Google's secure authentication system
‚úÖ FIREBASE AUTH: Google's enterprise authentication platform

  // Only store metadata, never content
  const metadata = {
    id: email.id,
    subject: email.subject,
    from: email.from,
    priority: classification.priority,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
  
  // Auto-expire cache
  setTimeout(() => clearCache(metadata.id), 120000) // 2 minutes
}
```

#### **Audit Logging**
```typescript
// Log all data access for transparency
const auditLog = {
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  action: 'email_processed',
